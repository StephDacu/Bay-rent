# Background and Information
Zillow is an American online real estate marketplace that provides information about homes, real estate listings, rental properties, mortgages, and home improvement.

Zillow uses data analytics and algorithms to estimate property values, known as "Zestimates," which are based on various factors such as location, square footage, and market trends. The platform allows users to search for homes, apartments, and other types of real estate, as well as to connect with real estate agents and lenders.
